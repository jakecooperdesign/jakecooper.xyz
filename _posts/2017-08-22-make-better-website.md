With tools like Squarespace, WordPress, and Wix (ugh), it's never been easier to make a website, yet still people struggle to make theirs "work". They can't get the traffic, the followers, or the job inquiries the site was made for in the first place. And worst of all they don't understand why. 

I know first-hand how that feels from making my first web portfolio in college. I thought all I had to do was put my "awesome" design projects online, and I could kick back as the job offers rolled in.

And then none did...

I researched online what I was doing wrong and realized my thinking was entirely backwards. I didn't consider how people would find me, or what type of people would even be looking for what I was making. 

I've built many websites since that first portfolio, and in that time I've evolved my design process to include planning for the things I know help my chances of making something my audience actually wants. 

If you're in the process of making a website for the first time, or are looking to refine the website you already have, here are some tips I use to build better sites.


## 1. Define your goals

Knowing your goals ahead of time helps you decide which features to keep and which to forget. Whether you want to gather emails, sell products, or drum up conversation, your website needs to make clear how your audience can use it and what actions they can take. 

Knowing this information up front will make the design process easier and more efficient as you have a clear target all elements of your website aim to hit.

To know which goals are important for your specific project, it helps to understand who your website is serving, what information you're trying to communicate with them, and why that information is important to know in the first place.

Here are some questions I use to work towards "the why" of my web projects:

- Who is the audience?
- What problems do they have?
- How will the website help solve those problems?
- How will the solution be unique from other solutions out there?
- What actions are do we want the audience to take?
- How will we measure the website's success?
- How will we get visitors to site in the first place?


## 2. Do your research

Researching doesn't have to be expensive or complicated, but the more you know about your audience, the better you can refine your content into something they actually want. 

### Research the competition
Research how other people have tried to help your customers before, and understand what works and doesn't work about each approach. Essentially you're using your competitors' mistakes to build things already approved by your audience. 

### Find the data
Researching data to support you content is an obvious, but great way to help build trust with new visitors to your site. Linking to articles and facts from other sources helps build credibility, even when covering something subjective. The fact that other people share or inform your opinion helps to make your thoughts more supported and less "risky" to believe.

### Discover existing communities
Research can also lead you to discover communities and resources already working to solve your problems. This creates an interesting opportunity to engage with a ready-built audience that shares the same motivations and interests.

By discovering the channels where your audience already hangs out, you can better understand what they care about, how they're solving their problems currently, and the specific language they use to describe what you do. 


## 3. Choose the right tools for the job

With so many choices to choose from when building a website, it's easy to get overwhelmed and pick what everyone else is using. Don't force something to work when it's clear the fit just isn't right.

### Pick the format that fits your content
If you're an amateur chef trying to share your creations, naturally you're going to want the ability to add recipes to your website. For other professions/goals, that decision of what and how to post isn't so obvious. 

Consider what message you want to share first and then explore the formats available that can offer the best, most exciting/engaging "package" for that message. For example, recipes are the status quo for amateur chefs and food blogs, but Buzzfeed's Tasty team has reinvented how people learn to cook through their short-form videos and GIFs. 

There's no definitive best solution for any kind of content, but experimenting with new ways of delivering information can be a great way to differentiate yourself from other options, and to learn more about how your audience prefers to learn.

### Understand your needs before picking a CMS
With all of your content in mind, pick a web platform/CMS that fits your needs. Squarespace might seem like it offers a lot of flexibility in the types of content you can create, but maintaining content on the platform can be more time-consuming than it's worth. 

Maybe you don't need an admin dashboard at all and prefer to work directly with google spreadsheets or even code? A static-site solution like Jekyll might be a better fit than a more robust option like WordPress. 

Understanding what role you or your team will play in the creation, editing, and publishing of content through your website can hugely narrow down which platforms are right for your specific site. 

### Automate as much as possible
Lastly, there are plenty of tools that can make running your website easier. Whether you're trying to promote your content on social media, or need to sync tasks and calendars with your writers, taking the time to investigate tools to automate any aspect of your writing/editing/designing/marketing process can save you many hours of cumulative time in the long run.


## 4. Assemble your team

There are many roles to play when building a website: designer, developer, editor, writer, customer support, marketer, promoter, etc. Whether you're taking all of it on yourself or working with a team, knowing who's in charge of what, and how to best contact/work with them will be crucial to keeping your site running smoothly.

Who do you call when you're website is down?
Who do you call when you need a backup of your site?
Who do you call to make changes to the design?

Whether you have a support team or a suite of third-party services that help out, delegating some of your website responsibilities frees you up to focus on doing what you do best. When you're at the point where you can afford extra help, definitely don't waste the opportunity, I guarantee it will pay off in the end.


## 5. Design a delightful, branded experience  

Design impacts the entire experience of your website, which can be a double-edged sword. A great design will make finding, enjoying, and sharing your content a breeze, where a poor design can needlessly complicate and frustrate your audience to the point that they don't care about what you have to say. 

Because of this fact, design should be one of the most important things you focus on when building a website. Below are the no-brainer tips I use to better design websites with my audience in mind.  

### Make things clear
Just as your website should have a clear overall purpose, each page of your website should encourage a specific function (aka "call-to-action") that moves your audience closer to that goal.

Your audience doesn't have the patience to figure out the hidden structure of your website's content, so your design should make it as clear as possible how to access the content they want and what actions they can take on each page. Each page should clearly mark what's most important and least important so that your audience has no friction in finding what they were originally looking for. 

The simple design goal for any page is to visually direct each visitor through your content (aka "what they want") and toward the call-to-action that helps achieve your website goals.

### Create a responsive design
Responsive design doesn't mean simply adjusting the layout for different screen sizes, it means understand how the needs of your audience changes in the context of each device. By creating a more focused, context-aware layout as the screen gets smaller, you remove the annoyances that preventing your audience from enjoying the great content you've created for them. Consider not just how things should change from one size to another, but what things should be removed (or added) that can make getting what your audience wants even easier.

### If you're picking templates, pick what's best for your audience
Many platforms will offer beautiful, well-designed, pre-built templates to choose from, but what they don't account for is whether those designs are right for your audience. Your audience is made up of a specific group of people that have clear preferences for certain design styles based on their cultural and contextual experiences. It's important to consider your audience's expectations and preferences when selecting a web design before getting caught up in flashiness, trendiness, and polish of a web design that may not be right for their needs.

Don't forget that you're building a website with a specific goal in mind. While a design might be objectively beautiful in a vague sense, it can very well be the wrong choice for your subjective, specific audience.

### Incorporate your brand wherever possible
Personality is the ultimate differentiator -- whenever possible always try to be yourself. Your branding (color palette, typography, graphics, illustrations, photos, etc.) should dually speak to both who you and your customers are. Your website should be able to create a tailor-made environment that can visually reflect the shared goals and desires of your project and your audience. 

The best way to achieve this is to work with a designer to make a brand style guide that establishes the rules and "default styling" for your content. A style guide defines a visual aesthetic that strategically reflects visual language of your audience and your brand personality, while offering the rules that create a consistent, memorable experience for your audience  to enjoy.

## 6. Create a reason for your audience to come back

In the midst of creating all this great content that solves your audience's problems, don't forget to give them a reason to seek out your advice again. The goal of your website should not be to make a one-time offer, but to build a relationship with an audience of fans/subscribers/peers that resonate with what you have to say. To get to that point you have to deliver value repeatedly, and build trust with your audience. Here are some tactics to build into your site a repeatable, valuable experience for your audience.

### Build a blog
Blogging is a great way to establish an ongoing communication with your audience. Whether writing posts that share your story in real time, or tackling your audience's problems one by one, blogging indicates a commitment to multiple communications that dedicated visitors will appreciate in the long-term.

### Offer new resources
Your audience grows and changes over time, and a great way to grow with them is to offer periodic resources that address their changing needs. How-to guides, workbooks, and checklists are easy-to-make solutions that keep your audience engaged and coming back to your website to learn more.

### Build a community
Whether you're growing your newsletter list, a Facebook page, or just hosting webinars from your office, your audience is your micro-community of people that care about the same things you do. Your website is a great way to nurture and channel that community by being the hub where people can respond, interact, and feed each others passions.
