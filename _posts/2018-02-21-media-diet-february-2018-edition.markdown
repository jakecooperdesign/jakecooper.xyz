Short reviews of some of the things I’ve been watching, reading, hearing, and gawking at. I’ve been in between about 5 different books at the moment, but I’m hoping to have a few more finished and shelved next month around so I can round out this media diet.

<!-- more -->

**[Black Panther](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjDjIWPwcPU)** - For sure, one of the best Marvel movies to date. The story itself was easily one of the most thoughtful and refined takes yet. Many comparisons have been made between this movie and Hamlet, or the Lion King, and those influences are both clear and worth it in the final cut. Most importantly, the motives behind every character were believable and significant (which is a common thorn in Marvel’s side) although in some ways under-acted (sorry Michael B. Jordan). (A-)

**[The Shape of Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiA4B5Y63IQ)** - I will always love Guillermo Del Toro’s movies. Pan’s Labyrinth has been one of my favorites ever since I first saw it. While the cinematography was gorgeous and elegant, the film emphasizes plot over acting, making for a memorable movie without necessarily memorable performances. Sally Hawkins is the one exception. For a silent role she did a great job of servicing the story and conveying the emotional weight of the story without overacting the part. Michael Shannon on the other hand, did not give his best (I hate to say). (B\+)

**[Queer Eye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZMrivD2Aok)** - I haven’t seen the original, but I have to admit I really enjoy this show. It’s not exactly hard to imagine myself in the role of a nice but unkempt guy in need of a makeover. The series hosts do an excellent job rehabbing a person’s game in a week’s time, with the exception of Karamo who’s role seems a bit under-baked and overinflated. While all hosts can pull their own weight some segments unfortunately feel abbreviated to fit the episode. The best thing I could hope for in a season two (fingers crossed) is spending more time teaching instead of showing. (B\+)

**[I, Tonya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXZQ5DfSAAc)** - Margot Robbie and Allison Janney steal every scene they’re in, but what’s amazing about this movie is that the story itself supersedes the great acting. The craziest thing about this crazy movie is that it’s (\*mostly) a true story. (A)

**The West Wing** - I’ve been re-watching this series for months now and it’s serving as a great antidote to often soul-sucking buffoonery of the Cheeto in Chief. It’s bittersweet to see such a courageous, intelligent, empathetic and emotional president on one channel, and on the next see another president completely lacking in all those ways. I’d vote for Jed Bartlet in a heartbeat, even if it’s just Aaron Sorkin telling Martin Sheen what to say. (A)

For a sample, here's a 10 examples of Jed Bartlet flexing as president

**[Sapiens](https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316117/ref=sr_1_3_twi_pap_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1519216816&sr=8-3&keywords=sapiens)** - I’ve barely started this book and already I feel like I’ve learned more about humans as a species than ever before. It’s fascinating to see how so many factors from 200,000 years ago effect our modern day psychology and culture. Definitely worth picking up and taking your time with. (A)

**[Tambourine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz46th3HSMU)** - Chris Rock’s latest special brings us a more vulnerable Rock exploring the aftermath of his recent divorce and his frustrations with the justice system, Trump, and religion. It’s a great set, but ironically it felt a bit short at just under an hour. The through line: “Sometimes, you sing lead. And sometimes, you’re on tambourine. And if you’re on tambourine, play it right.” (B\+)

**[SpaceX Launches the Falcon Heavy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbSwFU6tY1c)** - I watched the live stream of SpaceX making history and it was definitely one of the most inspiring things I've ever seen. That space-age dreaming of the future optimism, yeah I’ve got it now. (A\+)
