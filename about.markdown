I grew up in Trumbull, CT where my inclination for math, science, and art class led me on my way to becoming an architect. After being accepted to the Rhode Island School of Design, I realized that what I thought was passion for architecture was really a passion for all things design — graphic design being the most encompassing of the options available at RISD. I graduated with an emphasis on both branding and web design in all of my projects, and moved to New York City with a job in tow. I worked my way to the title of Art Director creating branding and communications for many large companies. I’ve since moved back to Connecticut, Stamford this time, with my lovely girlfriend Cait, where I commute back to the city as well as run JCD for my select clients.
